# BookNest

A web application for managing and cataloging book records, designed as a tech challenge project of 7 days with essential CRUD operations and image/summary generation with OpenAPI integration.

## Description

BookNest is a full-stack web application designed to manage book records. It allows users to add, edit, delete, and view book information through a simple and intuitive interface. Key features include integration with OpenAIâ€™s DALL-E for book cover image generation and GPT-3.5 for creating short book summaries. The project was built with Vue 3 and Vite for the frontend and Node.js with Express for the backend, with a PostgreSQL database for persistent storage

## Built With

- [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) - The web framework used
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - The build tool used
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - The runtime environment
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - The web framework used
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - The database used
- [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) - The API used for cover image generation and summary creation
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) - The HTTP client used
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - The CSS framework used
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) - The code formatter used

## Decisions

- The book cover generation works with image urls and not with downloaded images. The image urls generated by the OpenAPI last for 1 hour. For this purpose I think the image urls are a simpler and lighter approach for this project type level.
- For the authentication it is used Json Web Token. At a first instance I tried to do the authentication with user sessions using cookies but there were some problems related to persisting the user session after the log in so the final decision was to use JWT authentication.
- The app is mostly responsive for any desktop/laptop sizes but for now it is not responsive for mobile.

## Getting Started

### <mark>Important</mark>

Use this admin credentials to login as an admin user:

- username: admin
- <mark>password: admin123</mark>

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- PostgreSQL 17 (for database management)

## Easiest setup

### Setup and deploy using <mark>deploy.bat</mark>

The easiest way to deploy the project after having all the prerequisites installed is to double click the executable script deploy.bat in the project root folder. This will initialize the database with the correct properties from the .env file, create the necessary tables, install all the dependencies for both frontend and backend and run them. If you prefer to do it manually, follow the steps below.

## Manual setup

### Database setup

- Start PostgreSQL server with the properties provided in the .env file or adapt the .env file accordingly
- Create a database with the name provided in the .env file or modify the .env file accordingly
- Copy the create table query from the sql_script_create_books_table.txt file provided in the main folder of the project in order to create the table needed

### Installing

- Download the zip file and extract it to a folder of your choice
- Navigate into the project directory
- If it is not already there, move the provided .env file inside the backend root directory
- Navigate to the backend directory and install the dependencies with npm install
- Navigate into the frontend directory and install the dependencies with npm install

### Executing program

- Navigate to the backend directory and run npm start, it will start the server on port 5000
- Navigate to the frontend directory and run npm run dev
- The frontend will open on your browser at http://localhost:5173 or if it doesn't open automatically go to the link provided in the terminal
